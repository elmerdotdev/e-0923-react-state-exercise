# E-0923 React State Exercise

Create these 3 buttons in your React application. Use *useState*. You are free to name the states whatever you like. CREATE A NEW BRANCH CALLED 'dev' OR 'develop'. DO NOT WORK ON MASTER/MAIN BRANCH.

**Button 1: Toggle “On/Off” the lights**

Change the background color of a **div** container to white if isLightsOn is true, black if false.

**Button 2: Lotto numbers (Random 7 numbers from 1-50)**

Generate and display 7 random numbers from 1-50. You can display the numbers in a **div** element.

**Button 3: Click counter**

Every time you click on the button, it adds 1. You can use the default counter provided by React when you first installed.
